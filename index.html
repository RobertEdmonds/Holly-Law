            <h3 id="missionStatement">I have tried over 100 cases with returning my clients with a colective of one million dollars more.
                I got into this type of law because both my husband and I were in serious car accidents and we relized without proper console the insurance companies are not going to pay you for the pain and suffuring you are going to be filling for the rest of your life.
                We have a caring and strong team to get the most out of the insurance companies and we are not scared to go to court to do it.
                We believe that ever case is unique and desirves indivualized attention.
